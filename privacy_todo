1. Types of Personal Information Collected and Methods of Collection
This service does not have a sign-up function and does not require information that can directly identify a user, such as name, phone number, or email address.
However, to provide app features, the following information may be stored on the user’s device or collected through third-party services (advertising/payment SDKs).
Information stored within the app (local storage, no developer server)
To-do content (text memo)
To-do date (e.g., schedule information in YYYY-MM-DD format)
For location-based to-dos:
Location group (place name/nickname)
Latitude/longitude coordinates of the place
Geofence radius information (e.g., 200m, 300m, etc.)
Notification-related settings (notification on/off, cooldown, etc.)
App settings (language, onboarding guide display status, etc.)
Ad removal purchase status (a simple flag indicating premium status)
The above information is stored only on the user’s device and is not transmitted to any separate server operated by the developer.
Information collected/used through device permissions
Location information
Purpose of use: To provide location-based to-do (geofence) notifications and low-power backup location updates
Type: Current location coordinates obtained via the device’s GPS/Wi-Fi/cell tower information
Permission types:
“Allow location access while using the app”
“Allow location access all the time (background location)”
Notifications
Purpose of use: To display notifications when a to-do is due or when entering a geofenced area
Permission type: Push/local notification permission
Information that may be automatically collected by third-party SDKs (ads/payments)
Advertising platforms (e.g., Google AdMob)
Advertising ID (ad identifier), device information (model, OS version), app usage data, partial IP information, etc.
This may be used for ad targeting, fraud prevention, and statistical analysis.
In-app purchases (IAP, Google Play Billing / Apple In-App Purchase, etc.)
Purchase history, purchase tokens, transaction IDs, and other minimum information necessary for payments
The payment details themselves are managed by the store (Google/Apple), and the developer only checks whether a purchase has been made in order to provide the ad-removal feature.
For what data each SDK collects and how it is used, please refer to the privacy policies of those service providers
(e.g., Google LLC’s AdMob, Google Play billing services, etc.).
2. Purpose of Processing Personal Information
This service uses the collected information only for the following purposes:
Providing to-do management features
Storing and displaying to-dos, dates, and location information entered by the user
Displaying today’s to-dos and location-based to-dos
Providing location-based notifications
When the user enters a user-defined place radius (geofence),
notifications are sent for the “today’s to-dos” linked to that place
Low-power location updates are used to supplement geofence events
Providing notification features
Displaying local notifications when a to-do is due or when entering a location
Applying notification cooldowns and preventing duplicate notifications for the same place
Providing advertisements and paid features
Showing in-app ads (banner, interstitial, etc.) to free users
Offering an in-app purchase option to remove ads and checking purchase status
Service quality improvement and error handling
Using in-app error logs and simple statistics (e.g., ad load failures, geofence behavior logs)
to fix bugs and improve performance
Even in this process, information that directly identifies the user is not collected.
3. Retention and Use Period of Personal Information
Information stored on the user’s device (to-dos, locations, settings, etc.)
Stored on the device for as long as the user uses the app.
When the user deletes the app or initializes data within the app, the relevant information is deleted from the device.
Information collected and retained by third-party services (ads/payments)
Retention periods follow the policies of each service provider.
The developer does not separately store personally identifiable information or raw payment details.
4. Provision of Personal Information to Third Parties
The developer does not provide users’ personal information to third parties, except in the following cases:
When the user has given prior consent
When required by law
When requested by investigative agencies through lawful procedures
When third-party SDKs used within the app (for ads/payments) collect and process information on their own
In such cases, the information is processed in accordance with each SDK provider’s privacy policy and terms.
5. Outsourcing (委託) of Personal Information Processing
The developer does not entrust user personal information processing to separate contractors (“processors”).
However, to provide features such as ads, payments, and notifications, the app uses external platform SDKs.
Each platform acts as an independent personal information controller and processes data under its own responsibility.
Examples:
Ads: Google AdMob, etc.
In-app payments: Google Play Billing, Apple In-App Purchase, etc.
6. Users’ Rights and How to Exercise Them
Users can perform the following actions at any time within the app:
Edit/delete to-do and location information
Delete the app to remove all data
Through device settings, users can control:
Granting/revoking location permissions
Allowing/restricting background location usage
Granting/revoking notification permissions
Resetting/clearing the advertising ID (Android/iOS OS features)
In-app purchase (ad removal) history is managed based on the store account:
When the store account is changed, purchase history may not be carried over.
If a “Restore Purchase” function is provided, users can restore purchases via the “Restore Purchase” menu in the app.
7. Procedures and Methods for Destroying Personal Information
Data on the user’s device
When the user deletes the app or initializes data within the app,
to-do/location/settings information stored on the device is deleted in a way that cannot be restored.
No separate server-stored personal information
This service does not store user personal information on its own servers.
Information stored by third-party services
Destruction of information stored by third-party services (ads/payments, etc.)
follows the privacy policies of those respective service providers.
8. Measures to Ensure the Security of Personal Information
The developer makes the following efforts:
Principle of minimum collection
No sign-up/login features; only the minimum information required to provide the service is used.
Local storage first
To-do content, location information, and settings are stored only on the user’s device.
Separate server storage/transmission is minimized.
Using OS and SDK security features
Utilizing the permission system and sandbox structure of Android / iOS
Using in-app purchase and ad SDKs provided by the official app stores (Google/Apple)
Updates
If security vulnerabilities are discovered or policies change,
updates and notices will be provided through app updates and/or announcements.
This app may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice.
By continuing to use the app, you are deemed to have agreed to the above. If you do not agree, please stop using the app.
